# LearnReact.js
Tinkering project about how to use basic React development and a little bit of Redux.
> still need to work on project architecture, so I'm sorry if it a little bit messy.

### How to use
Install dependecies with command:  
```
npm install
```
Make sure you've installed webpack and webpack-dev-server
```
npm install -g webpack
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
```
Start project with command:  npm start
```
npm start
```
