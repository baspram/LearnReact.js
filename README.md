# LearnReact.js
Tinkering project about how to use basic React development and a little bit of Redux.
> still need to work on project architecture, so I'm sorry if it a little bit messy.

### How to use
1. Install dependecies with command:  
		```
		npm install
		```
2. Make sure you've installed webpack and webpack-dev-server
		```
		npm install -g webpack
		npm install -g webpack-dev-server
		```
3. Start project with command:  npm start
		```
		npm start
		```
